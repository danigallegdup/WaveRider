## üì• Installation

### Web Version

The latest version of Wave Rider can be played directly in your browser by visiting [our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/danigallegdup/WaveRider/releases) or on [itch.io](https://danigallegdup.itch.io/waverider).

> **Note:** If downloading the web version from GitHub Releases, you'll need to run a local server to play it properly. You can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
>
> ```
> # Python 3
> python -m http.server
>
> # Python 2
> python -m SimpleHTTPServer
> ```
>
> Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

The itch.io version can be played directly without any additional setup.

### Windows Executable

1. Download the latest `.exe` release from our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/danigallegdup/WaveRider)
2. Run the executable - no installation required!

## üéµ Adding Custom Songs

Wave Rider allows you to add your own songs to the game! Here's how:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+ installed
- Required Python packages: librosa, numpy
- Your favorite music files (MP3, WAV, M4A, and any other format supported by librosa)

### Installation Steps for Custom Music Analysis

1. Install required Python packages:

   ```
   pip install librosa numpy
   ```

2. Run the extraction script located in `MIR\scripts` with your music file:

   ```
   python extract_song_data.py --file-name "path\to\your\song.mp3" --name "Song Title" --genre "Rock" --artist "Artist Name"
   ```

3. The script will:

   - Copy your music file to the `AppData/Wave Rider` directory
   - Analyze the audio to detect beats, onsets and other musical features
   - Generate a JSON file with all necessary game data
   - Save everything to your `AppData/Wave Rider` directory

4. Launch the game and your song will appear in the song selection menu!

### Recommended Song Parameters

For the best gameplay experience, songs with:

- Clear beats and rhythm
- Duration between 2-5 minutes
- Distinct musical sections

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

Wave Rider is built with the Godot Engine and uses several music information retrieval techniques:

- **Beat Detection**: Identifies the rhythmic pulse of the music
- **Onset Detection**: Finds notable audio events for obstacle placement
- **Chroma Analysis**: Analyzes harmonic content to create matching color palettes
- **Spectral Analysis**: Processes audio frequency data for visualizations

## üìä Case Study & Future Work

We conducted a case study with volunteers who played Wave Rider and provided valuable feedback:

- **User Experience**: Players enjoyed the music synchronization but requested more difficulty options
- **Visual Feedback**: Several players suggested improved visual cues for obstacles and collectibles
- **Performance**: The game needs optimization for smoother performance on lower-end devices

### Future Improvements

Based on volunteer feedback, we're planning to implement:

- [ ] Difficulty selection menu (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- [ ] Enhanced sprite designs and animations
- [ ] Additional visual effects tied to music intensity
- [ ] More detailed tutorial section
- [ ] Expanded custom song compatibility

We're committed to incorporating user feedback to make Wave Rider even better!
